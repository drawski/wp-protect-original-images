WordPress plugin to make your images in original size not exposed to the world.

== Description ==

This plugin restricts access to your media files (jpg, png, gif, bmp) in original size for anyone but admin. This may be helpful for anyone who uses some plugins to add watermarks for smaller image sizes and wants to keep an option to regenerate them form the original without exposing it to the world.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-protect-original-images` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
